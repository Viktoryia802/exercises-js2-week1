/*

Think of 5 different real world "things" that you 
can describe with a JavaScript object

Assign each of them to a separate variable


For example:
*/
var car = {
  brand: "Mercedes",
  model: "Jeena",
  color: "Red",
  horsepower: 170,
  doors: 4
};
console.log(car);

var book = {
  author: "Ray Bradbury",
  name: "451Fahrenheit",
  pages: 450
};
console.log(book);
